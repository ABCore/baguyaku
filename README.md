# SMW-Data
The ``Disassembly`` folder contains commented banks of SMW I've written, using the [smw-irq](https://github.com/Alcaro/smw-irq) project as a basis. Formatting may be somewhat inconsistent due to being written over the course of several years, but it should at least help you understand what the code is trying to do.

The ``Misc`` folder contains various other bits of information I've documented over time. Check each individual file for explanations of their contents.
